# Android Developer NanoDegree

## Project 1 - Popular Movies Stage 1

This is an Android Application developed by me (Saurabh Agrawal), as an 
academic requirement for the Udacity's Android Developer NanoDegree Program.

## Guide to run the App

The App uses themoviedb.org API for getting the movie data. It requires an API key to 
query for the data.
The API key can be entered in <b> line number 88 </b> of src/MovieGridActivity.java
Just replace "Keys.API_KEY" with your Key.
