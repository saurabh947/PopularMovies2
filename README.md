# Android Developer NanoDegree

## Project 1 - Popular Movies Stage 1 & 2

This is an Android Application developed by me (Saurabh Agrawal), as an 
academic requirement for the Udacity's Android Developer NanoDegree Program.

The project uses <a href="https://github.com/holgerbrandl/themoviedbapi">TheMovieDb API</a>, a
a java-wrapper around the JSON API provided by TMdB, which is an open database for movie and film content.

## Guide to run the App

The App uses themoviedb.org API for getting the movie data. It requires an API key to 
query for the data.
Make a new class called <b> Keys.java </b> in the package "src/.../constants" and just 
enter with your Key as a public string. Name it as <b> API_KEY </b> and you're good to go.
